The files in this directory are organized to facilitate easy removal
of unwanted features of this reentry implementation.  For example: 
the standard reentry package includes two basic types:  a transaction 
which ties up the workstation while running and performs reentry for the
initiating operator only, and a background "batch" process run by a
separate Batch RT performing reentry for all operators.  Both can be
used in a single installation, but if one or the other is not wanted, 
do not compile the associated files (see below) and remove the associated 
#define from the "hcomm_talr.h" file.

	tran
		This file contains routines used only by the reentry transaction 
		which runs real time and not by a batch RT.  This file may be
		discarded if the transaction-type reentry is not wanted.
		Routines in this file have prefixes TRAN, PRET, TVAL, or
		RENtran.

	batch
		This file contains routines used only by batch reentry.  If
		batch reentry is not wanted, do not compile this file and set
		the #define BASE_CFIG_BATCH to 0 in the base_talr.h file.
		Routines in this file have prefixes RENbat or SRQbat.

	misc
		This file contains miscellaneous PCL routines used by multiple 
		types of reentry.  This file must be compiled for any type of
		reentry.
		Routines in this file have prefix RENmisc.

	hostinit
		NOTE:  This file is now located in ...xmp/src/hcomm/cust.
		This file contains routines used only by batch reentry which may be
		initiated by a host.  These routines are custom and are included as
		an example only.
		Routines in this file have prefix RENhost.

	opinit
		This file contains routines used only by batch reentry which may
		be initiated by an operator.
		Routines in this file have prefix SRQop.

	inform
		This file contains routines used only by the optional reentry
		feature to display "REENTRY IN PROG" on the status line of all
		operators while batch reentry is being performed.
		Routines in this file have prefixes RENinf or SRQinf.

	Example.dst
		NOTE:  This file is now located in ...xmp/src/hcomm/cust.
		This file contains example code which is NOT compiled into the 
		Model Application.  The three routines in the file show an 
		implementation of Reentry initiation by a host status change 
		(to SSCP) followed by an attempt to sign on to a CICS session 
		at the host.  A successful signon will cause batch reentry to 
		be run.

	If batch reentry is not wanted, omit the files "batch,"
	"hostinit," "opinit," and "inform," and set the #define
	BASE_CFIG_BATCH to 0 in the base_talr.h file.

	If transaction reentry is not wanted, omit the files "tran" and "scr"
	and set the #define TRAN_REENTRY to 0 in the hcomm_talr.h file.

	If batch reentry is not to be initiated by the host, omit the file
	"hostinit" and set the #define HOST_MSG_REN_INIT to 0 in the
	hcomm_talr.h file.

	If batch reentry is not to be initiated by an operator, omit the file
	"opinit" and set the #define OPERATOR_REN_INIT to 0 in the 
	hcomm_talr.h file.

	If the status line is not to show when batch reentry is in progress,
	omit the file "inform" and set the #define REN_INFORM to 0 in the
	hcomm_talr.h file.
